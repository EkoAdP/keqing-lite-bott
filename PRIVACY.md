## Data Collection
### Data Collected
Guild ID is collected if settings are overridden.

Apart from Guild ID, no data is automatically collected; You may override the prefix the bot uses to trigger some of the responses by using the `serverconfig` slash command

You may also provide a role that the bot ignores or optionally displays a message to when the bot is triggered by a user with that role.

### Data Handling
Collected Data is stored in JSON format on-server and is only used for server-specific settings.
Bot Admins may access the data in the event of a failure caused by malicious data.

#### Data Sharing
Data is **not** shared with *any* third-party services.

#### Updating Data
The data may be updated when using specific commands.
Updating data will require the input of an end user.

No other actions may update the stored information at any given time.

#### Removal of Data
Manual removal of the data can be requested through email at bot@keqingmains.com
For security reasons will we ask you to provide us with proof of ownership of the server, that you wish the data to be removed of. Only a server owner may request manual removal of data and requesting it will result in the bot being removed from the server, if still present on it.
